1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
	setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
	setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
	
	
	The difference is that first one is a function declaration and so it is loaded before any code executed, 
	but second one is a function expression and is loaded when interpreter reach that code.



2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
	var myfunc = function(a, x) {
		return a * x;
	};
	var x = myfunc(2, 3);
	var y = myfunc;
	alert(x);
	alert(y(2,3));
	
	Both of them show after message as 6. First x works and then y.
	
	
3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
	says “BOOYAH!”
	setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
	setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
	
	
	 function booyah1() {
      alert("BOOYAH");
    }

    const booyah2 = function () {
      alert("BOOYAH");
    };
